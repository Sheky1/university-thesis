The frontend web part of the application has two CMS systems - one for admin, one for agencies that promote their vehicles, to manage and manipulate all the data related to the given role. The reservations can be made from a mobile app or a new, end user web application. 

This project could still be extended with more technologies. OAuth2 + OpenID Connect, AWS S3 storage integration etc.
